		<p>The town of Conyberry was sacked by barbarians years ago and now lies in ruins. The Triboar Trail runs right through the
		abandoned town, providing an easy landmark for locating the lair of the banshee Agatha. From the ruins of Conyberry,
		an old trail leads northwest into Neverwinter Wood. Agatha's lair is a few miles outside of town.</p>

		<p>"The forest grows dark and still as the trail winds deeper into the trees. Heavy vines and thcik layers of moss
		 drape the branches, and the air is noticeably colder than it was in the ruined villiage. Rounding a bend in the trail, 
		 you see a screen made from warped branches of trees standing close together, woven into a domelike shelter in the shadows.
		  A low doorway leads inside."</p>

		<p>"A home or sorts is sheltered within the dome of woven branches. It is sparsely furnished with chests, shelves, a table, 
		and a reclined couch, all of it old and of elven craft."</p>

		<p>Agatha senses the intrusion and manifests shortly after. "The air grows cold, and a powerful feeling of dread grips you. A 
		cold, pale light flickers in the air, rapidly taking on the form of a female elf, her hair and robes waving in a spectral wind.
		She might have been beautiful once, but a hateful expression twists her features now. "Foolish Mortals, What do you want here?
		Do you not know it is death to seek me out?"</p>
