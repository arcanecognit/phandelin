		<p>As you crest a low ridge, you spy the crumblings ruins of an old watchtower standing amid the rugged hills.
		The place is so old that the walls are only mounds of rubble enclosing a courtyard or sorts, adjacent to the
		broken stump of an old tower. A colorful tent has been set up in the middle of the courtyard but no one is in sight.</p>

		<p>Twelve zombies lurk inside the crumbled shell of an old watchtower. Passive perception 10 can smell a 
		deathly odor wafting from the tower's direction. Zombies shamble out of tower if characters approach.
		If battle errupts, Hamun Kost, the "evil mage", emerges from his tent and asks, "What is the meaning of this"</p>
