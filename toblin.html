		<p>In Keeper of the Stonehill Inn</p>

		<p>Toblin is a short, freindly,young human male. He's the native of the
		town Tribor to the east. He originally came to Phandalin to prospect, 
		but soon realised that he new alot more about running an Inn, than mining.</p>

		<p>The new town offered a good opportunity to become established.
		Toblin is upset that the red brands have been allowed to terrorized the town 
		and that Harbin Wester, the town master has done nothing to curtail them.</p>

		<p>He tries not to steer up trouble for fear that the red brands might retaliate.</p>
