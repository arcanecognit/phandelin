		well over a hundred years old. Daran is a fighter who served as a marshal and herlad
		for many years in the lands of the Dragon Coast, far to the Southeast. Retired at home</p>

		<p>Member of the Order of the Guantlet, a devout and vigilant group that seeks to protect others from the 
		depredations of evildoers. The order is always vigilant, ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and
		enact retribution against any who try to subjugate or harm others</p>

		<p>Daran is concerned about the redbrands, and he would like to see a group of adventurers teach the
		ruffians a lesson. "It's time someone took a stand against Glasstaff." "The rabble hang around the
		Sleeping Giant tap house, but their main hideout is under Tresendar Manor</p>

		<p>Quest: Old Owl Trouble Daran has heard stories from prospectors in the hills northeast of Phandelin
		that someone is digging around in the ruins known as Old Owl Well. More disturbingly, several 
		propspectors have reported being chased from the area by undead. He asks them to visit the site
		a two day march northeast. Find out who's there and what they're up to. He knows that the ruins
		are an old watchtower of an ancient magical empire known as Netheril, and he worries that dangerous
		magic might be dormant there.</p>
